# ⚖️ Legally-Shortieee

Welcome to my digital law school prep binder where cybersecurity and big dreams meet case law and courtroom dreams. This is my journey from securing clouds to studying case law. If you’re a first-gen student, a career switcher, or just nosy (👀), you’re in the right place.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- 📝 LSAT study notes, plans, and reflections
- 🧠 Weekly affirmations + mindset check-ins
- 🧾 Application resources (personal statement tips, school trackers, etc.)
- 🧑🏽‍⚖️ Law school prep notes (case briefs, outlines, legal terms)
- 🔐 Cybersecurity meets legal deep dives (coming soon!)

## 🛠 Tools I’m Using

- [x] LSAT Trainer by Mike Kim
- [ ] LawHub
- [ ] Google Sheets for tracking apps + scholarships
- [ ] GitHub to keep me organized and accountable (haiiii👋🏽)

## 💬 Why I'm Doing This

I’m documenting this journey not just for me but for anyone else who’s ever felt like law school wasn’t made with them in mind. This repo is how I’m staying grounded, growing, and helping others along the way.
